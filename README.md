Project:

    Water Cooler Stories

Water Cooler Stories is a web app that will allow you to vent about your work day. Users from the same industry will be able to write stories about their day and issues and have feedback from others within the same industry. 

Motivation for project:

After a being threaten to not graduate for the Amazing University of Arizona Coding BootCamp, 3 individuals with different characteristics (carne asada tacos is a common denominator between this 3 guys) got together and after long hours of thinking and consuming beer, got to the brilliant idea that completing 
with the project requested by the School, we will graduate on time. We decide on doing a Water Cooler Stories app after failing to find a good
way to express frustration within the jobs that we currently (some of this individual are unemployed) had. And a race to complete this on time was born.
